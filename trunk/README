SnipPad
-------

SnipPad is a knowledge management system in the same vein as a wiki on the web;
in fact, it uses a wiki rendering engine(radeox) as it's backend. The name 
comes from the wiki software that also uses radeox as it's engine, SnipSnap 
(http://www.snipsnap.org). 

Install
-------

For the source release, 'ant jar' needs to be run first, to create the 
binary jar file. Then 'snippad.sh' can be run to actually run SnipPad. I haven't
created a batch file for Windows yet, but it's relatively easy to do based on 
snippad.sh.

Usage
-----

The tree on the left contains a list of each 'page' of the document. The main 
part on the right is mostly a browser that displays the HTML version of the 
wiki content, with a normal text editor filling up the rest of the interface. 
The browser is read-only; editing is done in the text editor, and when saved, 
the wiki rendering engine produces HTML output which is display in the browser.

Future Plans
------------

Syntax highlighting for the text editor a is big one, along with the ability to 
edit pages of a SnipSnap site through SnipPad (which can then make use of the 
syntax highlighting).
